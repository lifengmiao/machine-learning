The Kernel trick involves kernel functions that can enable in higher-dimension spaces 
without explicitly calculating the coordinates of points within that dimension: instead, 
kernel functions compute the inner products between the images of all pairs of data in 
a feature space. This allows them the very useful attribute of calculating the coordinates 
of higher dimensions while being computationally cheaper than the explicit calculation of 
said coordinates. Many algorithms can be expressed in terms of inner products. Using the 
kernel trick enables us effectively run  algorithms in 
a high-dimensional space with lower-dimensional data.
