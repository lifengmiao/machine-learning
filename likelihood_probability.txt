What is the difference between “likelihood” and “probability”?
Discrete Random Variables

Suppose that you have a stochastic process that takes discrete values (e.g., outcomes of tossing a coin 10 times, number of customers who arrive at a store in 10 minutes etc). In such cases, we can calculate the probability of observing a particular set of outcomes by making suitable assumptions about the underlying stochastic process (e.g., probability of coin landing heads is p and that coin tosses are independent).

Denote the observed outcomes by O and the set of parameters that describe the stochastic process as θ. Thus, when we speak of probability we want to calculate P(O|θ). In other words, given specific values for θ, P(O|θ) is the probability that we would observe the outcomes represented by O.

However, when we model a real life stochastic process, we often do not know θ. We simply observe O and the goal then is to arrive at an estimate for θ that would be a plausible choice given the observed outcomes O. We know that given a value of θ the probability of observing O is P(O|θ). Thus, a 'natural' estimation process is to choose that value of θ that would maximize the probability that we would actually observe O. In other words, we find the parameter values θ that maximize the following function:

L(θ|O)=P(O|θ)
L(θ|O) is called the likelihood function. Notice that by definition the likelihood function is conditioned on the observed O and that it is a function of the unknown parameters θ.
