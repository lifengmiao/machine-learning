the VC dimension gives you a measure for the "separating capability" of the 
function family (e.g. hyperplanes, which, in 2D, are lines) by looking at 
how many points you can actually separate knowing nothing about the distribution of labels (for any combination of labeling).

If your data has 2 dimensions and the function family we're looking at is hyperplanes (which, in 2D, are lines), the VC dimension is 3. Since:
We can find at least one set of 3 points in 2D all of whose 8 possible labellings can be separated by some hyperplane. The diagram below shows 
this. The arrow points to the side with the points labelled blue.
We cannot find any set of 4 points, all of whose possible labellings, are separable by hyperplanes.
